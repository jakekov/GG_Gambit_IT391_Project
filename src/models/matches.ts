// i have to make a fetch to vlr to see if a match ended and id be getting the info anyway

//server checks vlrgg
//checks if any updates are needed in db 
//calculates odds if new match is upcoming
//checks for live status change and updates db so no one else can bet on it
//passes through the data and includes the calculated odds
//might also be beneficial to do it in two steps. immidiatly pass through the api request match data from vlr
//then add the odds from out db / newly calculatd ones
